- **Day 12-13:** **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Review different sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, etc.), their time complexities, and when to use them.
  - Practice problems: Sorting an array of strings by length, finding the kth largest element, etc.

- **Day 14:** **Review & Practice**
  - Focus on solving problems involving trees, heaps, and sorting.

### Week 3: Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and Searching Techniques

  - Practice problems: Detecting cycles, finding connected components, etc.

- **Day 17-18:** **Dynamic Programming**
  - Study the fundamentals of dynamic programming, including memoization and tabulation techniques.
  - Practice problems: Fibonacci sequence, coin change problem, etc.

- **Day 19:** **Binary Search**
  - Understand binary search and its application in different scenarios.
  - Practice problems: Finding an element in a rotated sorted array, square root calculation, etc.

### Week 4: Problem Solving Strategies & Mock Interviews
**Goal:** Apply what you've learned to more complex problems and simulate real interview scenarios.

- **Day 22-23:** **Divide and Conquer & Backtracking**
  - Study divide-and-conquer techniques and backtracking methods.
  - Practice problems: Merge sort, n-queens problem, etc.

- **Day 24-25:** **Problem-Solving Patterns**
  - Learn common problem-solving patterns like sliding window, two-pointer technique, etc.
  - Practice problems: Longest substring without repeating characters, container with most water, etc.

- **Day 26-27:** **Mock Interviews**
  - Simulate real interview conditions. Solve problems within a limited time frame.
  - Review your solutions, focusing on areas for improvement.

- **Day 28:** **Final Review**
  - Go over the most challenging topics you encountered during the month.
  - Solve a mix of problems covering all topics to solidify your knowledge.

### Tips Throughout the Month:
- **Practice Daily:** Consistency is key. Even solving one problem a day helps.
- **Understand Mistakes:** Spend time understanding why a solution didnâ€™t work and how to fix it.
- **Use Resources:** Platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces are great for practice.
- **Reflect:** After each problem, reflect on what you learned and how you can apply it in different contexts.

This plan will gradually build your skills, enabling you to tackle algorithmic challenges with greater confidence and independence.
